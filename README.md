# Nobel_Peace_Lecture_Analyis_with_NLP

# Introduction

In this project, the aim is to analyze the Nobel Lectures (often referred to as acceptance speechs) of Nobel Peace Laureates in hopes of finding patterns in the various lectures that show the evolution of the definition of peace.

Therefore, I decided to make my own page, similar to that of Wikipedia's List of Nobel Peace Laureates, on my website. This data can now easily be web scraped for anyone who wants to use it.

## 2. Build Web Scraper
